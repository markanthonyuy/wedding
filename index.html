    <h2 class="scroll-spy" id="groom-title">The Groom</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm <a href="https://markanthonyuy.com/" class="special">Mark</a> also known as Mac. I'm from the
      Philippines and <a href="https://youtu.be/yFEXYKIvpfQ?t=101" class="special" target="_blank">I'm a fun guy</a>.
      (Just imagine me saying that how Kawhi Leonard said it üòÇ) To be honest with you I never imagined that I will be
      having my own church wedding.
    </p>

    <p> Today I'll take you to our magical journey.</p>

    <h3 class="scroll-spy" id="groom-proposal">The Proposal</h3>
    <p>
      It was the 10<sup>th</sup> of October 2018 when I proposed to my lovely wife. It was our anniversary as a couple.
      After 8 years of being together I've
      finally decided put a ring on it. You know, like Beyonc√© said "If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it.
      Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!" üé∂üé∂
    </p>
    <p>
      I prepared a meal for us to celebrate. Cooked some pastas and had a good bottle of wine. My cousins Marvy and
      Lester helped me prepare. Thank you Boys! I don't really like to have a lot of people around when I propose. So
      it's just us. I bought a white gold ring, nothing fancy but gets the job done cause she says "Yes!"
    </p>

    <figure data-aos="fade-right"><img loading="lazy" src="img/groom/proposal.jpg" alt="" width="600"></figure>

    <h3 class="scroll-spy" id="groom-planning">The Planning</h3>
    <p>After the proposal, I'm not ready for what's coming. Wedding planning is <b>NOT EASY</b>. Let me give you a
      moment to sink that in. Paperworks, Venue and Church occulars, then you have to think of your Guest, Sponsors,
      Entourage, Finances (make sure you have the means to get this done and stick to your budget.) and countless of
      wedding expo that we attended and
      boy oh boy it was a handful. Did you know that I don't like crowds? Groups are OK but then I consider 5 people is
      a group and more than that is a crowd so "meh".</p>

    <p>It was quite a while when we found the Venue, Church, Photographer, Videographer and other suppliers that we
      want. But is so well worth it in the end. Trust the process!</p>

    <p>I'm planning to make a list of that by the way. If your interested, just let me know. LOL</p>

    <p>This all happened even if though we still haven't decided yet what is the exact date of our wedding day. It was
      June or July 2019 that we finally pick October 10 to be our wedding day. And yes, you read that right
      <span class="special">October 10 2019</span> was the original date of our wedding.
    </p>

    <p>The reason it was moved to October 4 2019 is because of the venue that we want is not available on October 10 but
      one of the hidden reason for me is that October 4 is also my wife's birthday so it's double whammy for me. 1 gift
      for two occasions and for future reasons that I won't be able to forget 1 of those occasions. Kapaw!</p>

    <h3 class="scroll-spy" id="groom-prenup">The Prenup</h3>
    <p>Fast Forward, we did our prenup. My good friend Floren took it for us. So we flew to Boracay on June with
      my
      friends to help but if you think about it they just goof around and make things harder for us. Such a great
      friends. üí©</p>

    <h3 class="scroll-spy" id="groom-bachelors-party">The Bachelor's Party and Continuation of Birthday Celebration</h3>
    <p>Bev set up a birthday party for me. Birthday and bachelor's party in one thrilling night imagine how
      crazy it's going to be. Girls in their lingerie trying to tease me, overflowing beers and tequila and a DJ that
      turns the roof on fire.
      Sadly, these are just all how I imagined it would be. It was a effing sausage party that I threw up because
      Christian
      made me drink half full glass of Jose Cuervo. üòÇ Kidding aside, It was a great night but the throwing up was true.
    </p>

    <h3 class="scroll-spy" id="groom-pamamanhikan">The Birthday / Pamamanhikan</h3>
    <p>On September 22, which happens to be Kikoy's birthday and coincidentally mine. üéàüéÇüç∫ We've decided to meet the
      families of both sides. The Filipino tradition of "Pamamanhikan". It was great to see that everyone is getting
      along and just enjoying the moment. Our families are getting bigger and bigger.</p>

    <figure data-aos="fade-left"><img loading="lazy" src="img/groom/parents.jpg" alt="" width="600"></figure>

    <p>Seeing our parents smile together melts my heart. I hope we can keep them smilling for as long as they lived. ‚ù§Ô∏è
      I love our parents. Thank you for giving us the life that we enjoyed.
    </p>

    <figure data-aos="fade-right"><img loading="lazy" src="img/groom/whole-gang.jpg" alt="" width="600"></figure>

    <p>Guess how many are from the Uy's side here? Haha.</p>

    <h3 class="scroll-spy" id="groom-a-day-before">The Day Before the Wedding</h3>
    <p>A day before the wedding Marvy and Jhay-r is trying their best to calm the shit out of me because I'm anxious as
      hell, the mixed feelings of excitement and worry is driving me nuts. We are doing the last minute preparation and
      went to Bambang to buy my father's wheelchair. What a day. My face tells that I'm not sure what I'm getting in to.
      üòÇ</p>

    <figure data-aos="fade-left"><img loading="lazy" src="img/groom/a-day-before.jpg" alt="" width="600"></figure>

    <p>October 4, 2019, finally the day arrived I slept at 4 am woke up 7 am and it all went so fast I could barely keep
      up. I just want to say that the guest and the entourage that we had was the best. So let me just put all these
      images and the SDE to write the thousand words I want to say. Enjoy!</p>
